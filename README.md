## üì¶ Install Dependencies
Running flyteconsole locally requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). Once these are installed, you can run application locally.
For help with installing dependencies look into
[Installation section](CONTRIBUTING.md#-install-dependencies).

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. Follow [Start a Local flyte backend](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/getting_started/index.html), like:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm --privileged -p 30081:30081 -p 30082:30082 -p 30084:30084 cr.flyte.org/flyteorg/flyte-sandbox
    ``` 
2. Now, export the following env variables:

    ``
    export ADMIN_API_URL=http://localhost:30081
    export DISABLE_AUTH=1
    ``

   > You can persist these environment variables either in the current shell or in a `.env` file at the root
     of the repository. A `.env` file will persist the settings across multiple terminal
     sessions.

3. Start the server (uses localhost:3000)

    ``bash
    yarn start
    ``

4. Explore your local copy at `http://localhost:3000`

### Environment Variables

* `ADMIN_API_URL` (default: [window.location.origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location>))

    The Flyte Console displays information fetched from the FlyteAdmin API. This
    environment variable specifies the host prefix used in constructing API requests.

    *Note*: this is only the host portion of the API endpoint, consisting of the
    protocol, domain, and port (if not using the standard 80/443).

    This value will be combined with a suffix (such as `/api/v1`) to construct the
    final URL used in an API request.

    *Default Behavior*

    In most cases, `flyteconsole` will be hosted in the same cluster as the Admin
    API, meaning that the domain used to access the console is the same value used to
    access the API. For this reason, if no value is set for `ADMIN_API_URL`, the
    default behavior is to use the value of `window.location.origin`.

* `BASE_URL` (default: `undefined`)

    This allows running the console at a prefix on the target host. This is
    necessary when hosting the API and console on the same domain (with prefixes of
    `/api/v1` and `/console` for example). For local development, this is
    usually not needed, so the default behavior is to run without a prefix.

* `CORS_PROXY_PREFIX` (default: `/cors_proxy`)

    Sets the local endpoint for [CORS request proxying](CONTRIBUTING.md#cors-proxying-recommended-setup).

### Running from docker image as localhost

To run flyteconsole directly from your docker image as localhost you must set a
few environment variables in your run command to setup the appliation.

`BASE_URL="/console"` (required)

`CONFIG_DIR="/etc/flyte/config"` (required)

`DISABLE_AUTH="1"` (optional)

This example assumes building from ``v0.30.0`` on port ``8080``
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e BASE_URL="/console" -e CONFIG_DIR="/etc/flyte/config" -e DISABLE_AUTH="1" ghcr.io/flyteorg/flyteconsole:v0.30.0
```   


### Run the server

To start the local development server run:
```bash
yarn install    # to install node_modules
yarn start      # to start application   
```
This will spin up a Webpack development server, compile all of the code into bundles, 
and start the NodeJS server on the default port (3000). All requests to the NodeJS server 
will be stalled until the bundles have finished. The application will be accessible
at http://localhost:3000 (if using the default port).


## üõ† Development

For continious development we are using:
* **[Protobuf and Debug Output](CONTRIBUTING.md#protobuf-and-debug-output)**.
  Protobuf is a binary response/request format, which makes _Network Tab_ hardly useful.
  To get more info on requests - use our Debug Output
  
* **[Storybook](CONTRIBUTING.md#storybook)**
  \- used for component stories and base UI testing.

* **[Feature flags](CONTRIBUTING.md#feature-flags)**
  \- allows to enable/disable specific code paths. Used to simplify continious development.

* **[Google Analytics](CONTRIBUTING.md#google-analytics)**
  \- adds tracking code to the app or website. To disable use `ENABLE_GA=false`

More info on each section could be found at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### CORS Proxying: Recommended setup

In the common hosting arrangement, all API requests will be to the same origin
serving the client application, making CORS unnecessary. However, if you would like
to setup your local dev enviornment to target a FlyteAdmin service running on a different
domain you will need to configure your enviornment support CORS. One example would be
hosting the Admin API on a different domain than the console. Another example is
when fetching execution data from external storage such as S3.

The fastest (recommended) way to setup a CORS solution is to do so within the browser. 
If you would like to handle this at the Node level you will need to disable authentication
(see below)

> Do not configure for both browser and Node solutions. 

These instructions require using Google Chrome. You will also need to identify the 
URL of your target FlyteAdmin API instance. These instructions will use
`https://different.admin.service.com` as an example.


* Set `ADMIN_API_URL` and `ADMIN_API_USE_SSL`
   
   ```bash
   export ADMIN_API_URL=https://different.admin.service.com
   export ADMIN_API_USE_SSL="https"
   ```  
   
   > **Hint:** Add these to your local profile (eg, `./profile`) to prevent having to do this step each time

* Generate SSL certificate

   Run the following command from your `flyteconsole` directory
   ```bash
   make generate_ssl
   ```

* Add new record to hosts file

   ```bash
   sudo vim /etc/hosts
   ```
   
   Add the following record
   ```bash
   127.0.0.1 localhost.different.admin.service.com
   ```
   
* Install Chrome plugin: [Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf)

    > Activate plugin (toggle to "on")

* Start `flyteconsole`

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
   Your new localhost is [localhost.different.admin.service.com](http://localhost.different.admin.service.com)

   > **Hint:** Ensure you don't have `ADMIN_API_URL` set (eg, in your `/.profile`.)
