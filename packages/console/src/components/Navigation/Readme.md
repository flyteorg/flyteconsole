## Customize NavBar component

From this point forward you can modify your FlyteConsole navigatio bar by:

-   using your company colors
-   providing entrypoint navigation to sites, or places inside flyteconsole.

To use it you will need to define `FLYTE_NAVIGATION` environment variable during the build.

If you are building locally add next or similar export to your `.zshrc` (or equivalent) file:

```bash
export FLYTE_NAVIGATION='{"color":"white","background":"black","items":[{"title":"Hosted","url":"https://hosted.cloud-staging.union.ai/dashboard"}, {"title":"Dashboard","url":"/projects/flytesnacks/executions?domain=development&duration=all"},{"title":"Execution", "url":"/projects/flytesnacks/domains/development/executions/awf2lx4g58htr8svwb7x?duration=all"}]}'
```

If you are building a docker image - modify [Makefile](./Makefile) `build_prod` step to include FLYTE_NAVIGATION setup.

### The structure of FLYTE_NAVIGATION

Essentially FLYTE_NAVIGATION is a JSON object

```
{
    color:"white",          // optional - default NavBar text color, if not provided uses Flyte colors
    background:"black",     // optional - default NavBar background color, if not provided uses Flyte colors
    console:"FlyteConsole"  // optional - name of the default navigation, if not provided uses "Console"
    items:[                 // required - if no dropdown needed provide an empty array
        {title:"Remote", url:"https://remote.site/"},
        {title:"Dashboard", url:"+/projects/flytesnacks/executions?domain=development&duration=all"},
        {title:"Information", url:"/information"}
    ]
}
```

If at least one item in `items` array is present the dropdown will appear in NavBar main view.
It will contain at least two items:

-   default "Console" item which navigates to ${BASE_URL}
-   all items you have provided:
    -   If item's url starts with `+` sign, the navigstion would be treated as an internal one. + sign would be stripped and BASE_URL would be added to navigaiton

Feel free to play around with the views in Storybook:
